# The Eloquent Genius of Ray Hudson
Collection of quotes from the Magisterial One

* He's as nervous as a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs
* He's off like a prom dress
* He's finer than a frog's hair
* He's got his angles down like Pythagoras
* It's like throwing the keys to the bloodbank to Dracula
* It's as clear as the mole on Cindy Crawford's lovely face
* He peeled away from the defender like tissue on a toilet roll
* He needs help like a shark needs a dentist
* This game is more tense than 100 wigwams
* He's slippier than an eel covered in vaseline
* That's like showing your neck to dracula
* Both teams working harder than a one-eyed cat covering three mouse holes
* This game has more twists and turns than a drunk snake
* The defense goes missing like the kids from the Blair Witch Project
* That was as brave as a matador in a pink tutu
